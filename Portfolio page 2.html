		<p> This is where I will be talking about my Major and my designs. The major I am taking is game design and the reason why is because I enjoy gaming a ton and I always wondered how it works, the when I saw that ISU had the major I wanted, I instantly signed up for it. I worked on 2 games up to now, I worked on a card game in a group with 3 others, and made a board game solo. (didnt get them yet so I can't show it). But when I do, I will show them both off.</p>
